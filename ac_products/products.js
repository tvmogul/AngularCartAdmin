        "description": "One day I got a call from a young man who asked me if I could build him a website like his uncle's website and get his website listed number one on the search engines like Yahoo and Google. His uncle sold Lamps and he wanted a website like his uncle's that came up number one in all the search engines. I looked at his uncle's website and told the young man that I could create a similar website for him that be listed at the top of the organic section of Google and Yahoo on any searches for lamps. You are probably saying to yourself at this point... How is that possible? It can't be done! But it can be done because searches for lamps lend themselves to pseudo domains. A pseudo domain is a term used among a handful of developers like myself and it simply means a directory name with a space in the that can't be registered as a domain because of the space, i.e., domain names can't have spaces but folders, i.e., directories on servers can have a space in their names. The first thing I realized when I saw the uncle's lamp website selling lamps was that the main buyers of these lamps were interior designers who had the catalogs of all the lamp manufacturers but could not buy the lamps directly from the manufacturer--they had to find lamp distributors on the Internet. And they would do a search in Yahoo or Google using the name of the manufacturer, a space and the product id number. For example, they might type in: Crystal Lamps, Inc. Stone Lamp number 45789 into a search engine. Obviously their is NO domain with this name because of the spaces BUT if the uncle's website had a directory with this name and a file inside the directory with this name as well which resulted several types of search engines indexing this as what we call a pseudo domain so that anyone typing this into a search engine would immediately see the uncle's website listed at the top of the organic section. Of course, not all products are searched for in this way but those that are can easily be placed at the top of search engines legally by simply creating these pseudo domains. This course will reveal the tricks used by the most successful websites to We show you dozens of tricks like how to legally get 500,000 targeted YouTube views without violating YouTube's Terms of Service.  We explain how to setup 301 Redirect Domains with the correct search Terms and much more! We reveal all the legal tricks nobody else will tell you about.",
